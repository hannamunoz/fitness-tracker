## *Description*
This application is designed to help Dungeon & Dragons players easily keep track of players in the game without using the normal pen and paper. If players opt to play online, our application allows the user to sign in and see their campaigns and then edit their character. Our application follows MVC, uses express and node to create RESTful API's and MySQL and Sequelize ORM for databases.
